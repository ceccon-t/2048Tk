# 2048Tk
2048 with Python and Tkinter

Clone of famous game 2048, adapted to use only the most basic functionalities of Tkinter (which means no flashy animations).

Based on the mini-project for Week 2 of Coursera's [Principles of Computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/principles-of-computing-1) MOOC, where we used the online tool CodeSkulptor to develop the logic of the game, and the visual interface was provided by the instructors. My implementation using that set-up can be found [here](http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user43_i3hCxVxVwJ9etVL.py).
